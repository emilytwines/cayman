# Bio

Emily Twines is an interdisciplinary performance and technology artist with experience directing, writing, programming, and designing interactive theatrical elements. She earned her MA in Theatre History and Criticism and MFA in Performance and Interactive Media Arts at Brooklyn College. Current works include the live video game and community engagement project lookingGlass, and Self Portrait, a durational performance installation.

Other notable pieces include writing for The House, a short film by renowned director Cyril Teste and team, as well as I heard an echo, a collaborative installation at The Weeksville Heritage Center, for which she provided video and interactivity elements, and articles/reviews written for Cycling ’74 and All About Solo. She also recently wrote and performed a monologue for a Miseducated and a solo variety act called “On Progress” With Professor Steward Orwell Teric III at Bizarre Bushwick. Her MA thesis project, with its accompanying paper entitled Maintaining Subversion: A Contemporary “Endgame” Informed by the Mise en Scène Style of Ivo Van Hove, included the staging of a re-politicized adaptation of scenes inspired by Samuel Beckett’s 1957 play, which she conceptualized and directed, and for which she created audio and video design.

With the generous help of a Tow Summer Fellowship, Emily spent the summer working in France where she studied the tactics of French theatre during heightened political moments through three case studies: the 1789 Revolution, Mai 1968, and of the contemporary era today, taking into special consideration the Gilets Jaunes protests and the performances at the Festival d’Avignon. She is currently continuing this research stateside and preparing to create an original performance piece and an academic paper, working title: Performing Revolution: French Political Theatre Tactics of 1789, 1968, and Today.
