For this Interactive Theatrical Experience put on by The Heights Players of NYC, I created a WebGL 2.0 Unity game to support their filmic take on the classic choose-your-own-adventure-style narrative. 

After finishing my build from Unity, which  included 96 discrete scenes of video and interactive button cards, I created a Digital Ocean droplet to host the game, set up the Ubuntu Apache2 server, enabled https, and managed the files in WinSCP. 

I also created iPhone and Android builds of the game, which were not included in the official release. 

Show run: 1/29-2/14

- Unity Engine, C#, AvPro Video system
- Ubuntu 20.04 
- Apache2
- Digital Ocean, DNS management
- https implementation
- HTML/CSS
- WinSCP
