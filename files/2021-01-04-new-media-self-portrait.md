A socially-distanced interactive installation in the works, “Self Portrait” is to be composed of a video sculpture and walls filled with images: images of people; of friends; of family.

Prior to the performance dates, guests planning to attend will be asked to fill out a form with details about someone for whom they care deeply, providing a short story (200 words or less) that represents why their person is special to them, as well as a bust/head shot of the person. 

Then in preparation for the showing, I will draw 18x24" charcoal portaits of these submitted photos. On the back of each one, I will hand-write the story provided by the guest.

On showing dates, these portraits will be hung on all the walls of the space, and the video installation will be mounted in the center of the room -- a piece about self, about community, and about their inherent interrelation. 

Only a few participants will be able to experience the installation at a given time to maintain social distancing, but this also allows me an opportunity to create interactivity between their proximity to the walls and the audio in the video: as visitors approach the walls where the portraits hang, a previously indistinguishable track from the video will become clear, creating a sense of community and presence despite distance.

Wallet-sized prints of the drawings with stories on the back will be offered as add-ons to the admission fee, both will be modest sums or possibly available on a sliding scale. Raffle tickets to choose a portrait to take home will also be on sale at the door.

The original charcoal portraits and new commissions will also be available for purchase on a case-by-case basis.  


Dates TBA - stay tuned!
