title: "(Un)Twined"
excerpt: "A Study on Memory, Loss, and Human Resilience<br/><img src='../images/untwined.jpg'> (Un)twined was conceived, designed/programmed, and presented by John Baylies and myself as the final project for our 7010 course in the PIMA program at Brooklyn College in December 2018. Built from scratch and run from Max/MSP through a Touch OSC interface on my phone, this project explored the losses we had each experienced in our recent adult lives, touching on memory of loved ones, of home, and of what it means to be a family.

(Un)twined was conceived, designed/programmed, and presented by John Baylies and myself as the final project for our 7010 course in the PIMA program at Brooklyn College in December 2018. Built from scratch and run from Max/MSP through a Touch OSC interface on my phone, this project explored the losses we had each experienced in our recent adult lives, touching on memory of loved ones, of home, and of what it means to be a family.

A study of grief and of how people reconstruct meaning from dropped stitches in time as well as of how we build our own identities as, in part, products of our past lives, this short presentation only began to touch the surface of what could be a much larger project.
