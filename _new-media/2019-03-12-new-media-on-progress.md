I used MaxMSP for live audio modulation and video delay in this live solo performance.

This piece begins with a pitch-shifted “vaping professor” male drag version of myself who lectures on the topic of progress from Aristotle to Kuhn. 

<!--- more --->


As the text becomes more and more… exciting… video projection comes on with a pre-recorded version of the same lecture, and is progressively modified through MaxMSP to distort, loop, and echo itself while I as the live performer become more and more animated. 

Eventually I diverge from the projection in order to tend to a fallen potted plant. As the projected professor finishes the lecture alone, I experience the feeling of soil under my hands and against my skin as I try to scoop the spilled earth back into place.

A commentary on western progerss narratives and the masturbatory potential of endless theoretical debate, this variety show piece challenges the audience to address the here and now, the environment, and their relationship to their homes.
