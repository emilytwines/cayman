I used: MaxMSP, an IR camera, arduino, and co-directed the movement sequences.

This was a community event involving an outdoor party with music and food and an installation inside one of the Historic Hunter Fly Road houses at the Weeksville Heritage Center. The project was meant to help celebrate the history of the house, and to bring “the past into the present,” so to speak.

We all filmed the actors in the space, then I edited the media so that takes layered over each and then ran this product through a Max MSP patch that delayed the video so that it created visual trails as the actors moved. Although I liked the saturation of the above video, we eventually decided to tone it down a little, which I did directly in the Max program.

As part of the main conceit of the interactive installation, we asked both actors to wear the same dress as the basis of their costume, and each decorated the ensemble as they wanted. Then we hung the dress in a closet upstairs as a final experience for visitors. For this, I co-designed an Arduino necklace that hung with the dress and that blinked faster as a visitor approached to give the sense of a welcoming presence.
