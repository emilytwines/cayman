A socially-distanced durational performance installation in the works, “Self Portrait” is to be composed of a video sculpture and walls filled with images: images of people; of friends; of family.

Guests coming to the installation will be asked to submit a photo ahead of time of someone who is special to them. I will then draw charcoal portaits of these submitted photos for inclusion in the installation. 

Visitors to the exhibition will thus be able to see these drawings of their loved ones, alongside everyone else’s special people, realized in the piece. Everyone will be invited to take a portrait home, but not one of the images created from the photo they sent in.

Only a few participants will be able to experience the installation at a given time to maintain social distancing, but this also allows me an opportunity to create interactivity between their proximity to the walls and the audio in the video: as they approach the walls where the portraits hang, a previously indistinguishable track from the audio will become clear, creating a sense of community and presence despite distance.

I will draw continuously throughout the exhibition's duration to replenish the walls as folks take down and take home the images that strike them — images of people they don’t know, but whom they know are special to someone.

More info to come as the project develops. If you are interested in participating in any way or want to suggest a venue please reach out at emilytwines@gmail.com!
