Taken from a syllabus I created for a class called “The Dialectics of Dissent: Theatrical Performance as Political Action,” this sample class from the course, which I taught to my fellow PIMA students, covered artwork and performative statements created during and around the WTO protests in Seattle (1999).

Before class, the students were to read a few selections, listen to a podcast from Interference Archive, and review some images I sent out for homework as well as bring in ideas for one of their semester projects – a “Political Action” piece, that took what we were learning and encouraged the students to create their own political works. A year later, one of the participants has actually staged her project idea.
