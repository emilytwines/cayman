Taken from a syllabus I created for a class called “The Dialectics of Dissent: Theatrical Performance as Political Action,” this sample class from the course, which I taught to my fellow PIMA students, covered artwork and performative statements created during and around the WTO protests in Seattle (1999).

Before class, the students were to read a few selections, listen to a podcast from _Interference Archive_, and review some images I sent out for homework as well as bring in ideas for one of their semester projects – a “Political Action” piece, that took what we were learning and encouraged the students to create their own political works. 

I ended the class with a demonstration of our “fact of the week:” that eye flushes should be done with water (and not, for example, milk). We went outside to learn the appropriate technique from an interactive demonstration and surprisingly, other students walking by our class joined in.
