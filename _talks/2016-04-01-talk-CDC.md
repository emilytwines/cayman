Presented a paper titled “Puppet Dramaturgy: Curated vs. Created Work at St. Ann’s Warehouse.”

Does work created at the St. Ann's puppet lab differ fundemanetally from the work that they invite? Can we learn anything from comparing the two bodies of work? My paper sought to begin to answer this line of inquiry.
